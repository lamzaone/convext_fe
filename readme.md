# ConvExt - FRONT END
### Simple and effective file conversion web application using Angular 18

Our tool offers a wide range of supported files, with quick conversion and download speeds!
Just upload (select or drag/drop) your files, select the conversion type and let the tool do it's magic!

We use a variety of well known programs and frameworks that handle the conversion, so you can sit down and relax while we take care of your files without any loss of quality or file corruption.

Additionally, we offer a paid version that allows you to access your conversion history for up to 30 days, and extends the file upload maximum size ( 20mb/file -> 50mb/file).
